# OpenGL-Road-Car

A minigame involving a car on a road.

The road has been pictured using a Geogebra figure and marking down all edges to create an
overall smooth shape for it. The trees have been randomly generated on the sides of the
road. The number of trees spawned can be easily edited.

The car does not actually move on the road. It is generated in front of the camera, which
has a fixed angle on the road. The minimap is the result of a FOV view of a camera right
above the car.
